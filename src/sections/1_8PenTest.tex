    \subsection{Penetration Testing}
    \subsubsection*{\color{red}Threat Hunting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Known/Unknown/Partially Known Environment:} Whether the tester has prior knowledge of the system, no knowledge, or some knowledge.
        \item \textbf{Rules of Engagement:} Agreements or boundaries defined before the test, such as what can be tested, when, and how.
        \item \textbf{Lateral Movement:} Moving from one network segment to another, often to gain access to a specific target.
        \item \textbf{Privilege Escalation:} Gaining higher-level privileges, such as moving from user-level to admin-level access.
        \item \textbf{Persistence:} Maintaining access to the system, even after the initial intrusion has been detected and supposedly “cleared”.
        \item \textbf{Cleanup:} Removing any traces and reversing any changes made during the test.
        \item \textbf{Bug Bounty:} Programs by organizations rewarding individuals for identifying and reporting vulnerabilities.
        \item \textbf{Pivoting:} Using a compromised system to target other systems.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsubsection*{\color{red}Passive and Active Reconnaissance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Drones, War Flying, War Driving:} Using drones, aircraft, or vehicles to identify wireless networks.
        \item \textbf{Footprinting:} Gathering information about a target entity to find ways to infiltrate.
        \item \textbf{OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):} Using publicly available sources to gather data about a target.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{\color{red}Exercise Types}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Red Team:} Simulated attackers trying to compromise a system.
        \item \textbf{Blue Team:} The defenders who try to stop the red team.
        \item \textbf{White Team:} Neutral party, usually administrators, ensuring the test goes smoothly.
        \item \textbf{Purple Team:} A blend of red and blue teams, often where they work together to understand and remediate vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
