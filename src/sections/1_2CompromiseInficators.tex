        \item[Worm:] A self-contained infection that can spread itself through networks, emails, and messages.
        \item[PUP's:] Potentially Unwanted Programs software applications that may exhibit undesirable characteristics.
        \item[Memory-resident malware:] Operates primarily in a computer's volatile memory (RAM) rather than with files

        \item[Bots:] AI inside an infected machine performs specific actions as a part of a larger entity known as a botnet.

        \item[Logic Bomb:] A malicious program that lies dormant until a specific date or event occurs.
        \item[Spyware:] Software that installs itself to spy and sends stolen info back to the host machine.
        \item[Keyloggers:] A malicious program that saves all of the keystrokes of the infected machine.
        \item[Remote Access Trojan] (RAT) A remotely operated Trojan.

\subsubsection*{\color{blue}Password Attacks}
\begin{fullwidth}
    \begin{description}\itemsep2pt
        \item[Brute Force:] Systematically trying a large number of possible passwords.
        \begin{itemize}\itemsep2pt
            \item \textbf{Offline}: Attempting to crack a password hash without directly interacting with the target system, rather on their own independant computer.
            \item \textbf{Online}: Attempting to guess a user's password by repeatedly trying different combinations.
        \end{itemize}
        \item[Sprying:] A Type of brute-force attack by attempting to authenticate with commonly used passwords. Small number of passwords against many accounts.
        \item[Dictionary:] A password attack that creates encrypted versions of common dictionary words and then compares them against those in a stolen password file. Guessing using a list of possible passwords. 
        \item[Rainbow Table:] Large pregenerated data sets of encrypted passwords used in password attacks.
        \item[Plaintext/Unencrypted:] The attacker has both the plaintext and its encrypted version.
